## 🚀 How to Start

### Quick Start (Recommended)

```bash
./start.sh
```

### Manual Start

```bash
# 1. Create admin account (first time only)
"/home/emarat/Fashion Express/.venv/bin/python" manage.py createsuperuser

# 2. Start server
"/home/emarat/Fashion Express/.venv/bin/python" manage.py runserver

http://localhost:8000/
```

## � Environment Variables (.env)

To avoid CSRF 403 errors and make configuration easy, copy the sample env file and adjust values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Key settings to review:

- `DJANGO_DEBUG` — True for local development
- `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` — set to a strong, long random string (required for production)
- `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` — comma-separated hosts (e.g., `localhost,127.0.0.1,0.0.0.0`)
- `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` — comma-separated full origins including scheme and port (e.g., `http://localhost:8000,http://127.0.0.1:8000`)

Notes:

- If you access the site via a LAN IP like `http://192.168.x.y:8000`, add it to both `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` and `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` (as `http://192.168.x.y:8000`).
- In development, the app already trusts common local origins by default, but setting `.env` keeps things explicit and avoids surprises.
